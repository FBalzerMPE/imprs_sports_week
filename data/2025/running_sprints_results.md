### Overall results

All participants fought amazingly (especially in the face of some rain), running as fast as they could in a relay, an endurance and a sprints event.

The final scores they achieved are as follows:

Team A: 18 points\
Team B: 46 points\
Team C: 36 points.

More details on what they did might follow later; To calculate these, we took the individual results and weighted them by the different amounts of participants per big team.
