#### YOUR TEAM

We have worked hard to sort you into **three main teams** that send out players for each of the sports, enabling everyone to obtain points for their team.

You are a member of **{team_name}**.

Members of {team_name} should wear **{cloth_color} clothing** during the events. Additional bibs will be provided when necessary for certain sports.

------------------------------------------

#### YOUR SCHEDULE

You can find your **personalized match schedule** at the bottom of this mail. Please check it and **REPLY TO THIS EMAIL** to confirm that you are available to support your team in all matches you are scheduled to participate in!

Further details, including the latest schedule, teams, players, and contact details are available on the website:\

Please carefully read the **specifications for what to bring** for each of your sports! Usually, it's just a water bottle and appropriate clothing, but tennis and badminton, for example, **require proper shoes**.

------------------------------------------

#### YOUR AVATAR

To ensure anonymity when posting the results on the website, we have assigned a **randomized nickname** consisiting of *adjective + animal* for each player. This nickname will allow you to review all of your details on the website as long as you remember it.

Your nickname is **{nickname}**.

You can unravel other players' nicknames [here]({datashare_link}). We have attached your avatar in high-resolution.\
*[Roundcube and Outlook are the suggested email programs to view this attachment]*

You will also receive your **name tag** at the first sport you will participate in (apart from ping pong, for which you can approach e.g. Fabi).
