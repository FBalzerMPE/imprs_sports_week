Dear {first_name},

We're super excited to have you on board for the second INTER-INSTITUTE SPORTS WEEK!

In this email, you will find **important information** about your team, your nickname, your schedule and what to wear/bring to the event.\
Please read the following carefully and **REPLY TO THIS MAIL** to **confirm your attendance** or let us know of any issues.

{payment_text}

We have worked hard to sort you into **three main teams** that send out players for each of the sports, enabling everyone to obtain points for their team.

You are a member of **{team_name}**.

Members of {team_name} should wear **{cloth_color} clothing** during the events. Additional bibs will be provided when necessary for certain sports.

You can find your **personalized match schedule** below. Please check this and **REPLY TO THIS EMAIL** to confirm that you are available to support your team in all the matches you are scheduled to participate in!

Further details, including the latest schedule, teams, players, and contact details are available on the website:\
[https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/](https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/)

On there, please carefully read the **specifications for what to bring** for each of your sports! Usually, it's just a water bottle and appropriate clothing, but tennis and badminton, for example, **require proper shoes**.

Then, to ensure anonymity, we have provided a **randomized nickname** consisiting of *adjective + animal* for each player. This nickname will allow you to review all of your details on the website as long as you remember it. There is also a document [here]({datashare_link}) in which you can unravel other players' nicknames.\
Your nickname is **{nickname}**.

We have attached your avatar in high-resolution.\
*[Roundcube and Outlook are the suggested email programs to view this attachment]*

You will also receive your **name tag** at the first sport you will participate in (apart from ping pong, for which you can approach e.g. Fabi).

If you want to receive updates about the Sports Week, join our **[Signal group, linked here]({signal_link})**.

That's it for now! We hope you're as excited for the Sports Week as we are!

And again, please don't forget to reply to this email :)

The organizing committee\
Zsofi, Benny, Matteo, William, Mari, Guillaume and Fabi
