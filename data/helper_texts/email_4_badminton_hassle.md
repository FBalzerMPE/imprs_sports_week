Dear {first_name} ({nickname}),\
unfortunately, we have bad news about Badminton:\
The venue we initially planned with has been denied to us on short notice by the authorities (even though it had been confirmed before), so we will not have the 6 fields available from 17:45-21:00.

The only somewhat good alternative we've been given are 3 fields in the time slot of 15:45 - 17:45, which unfortunately does fall into working hours.

Therefore, we have decided to also offer an outdoor-option in the original time slot (17:45-20:00), in which we will have 3 outdoor fields (and are unfortunately subject to wind and weather).

**Please reply to this mail ASAP** by stating **which of the options** you could do:

1. Play during working hours at the gym (indoor shoes required, plan to be there ~15:30 on wednesday)
2. Play after working hours outdoors
3. Either one of the above options (we'll decide for you to make the player numbers fit, this offers some flexibility for us)
4. Drop out of badminton{extra_text}

We will provide an updated schedule after we have gathered your responses; your subteams, opponents, and time slots will most likely change.

We apologize for this change of plans, but hope we can make the best out of it.

The organizing committee\
Zsofi, Benny, Matteo, William, Mari, Guillaume and Fabi
