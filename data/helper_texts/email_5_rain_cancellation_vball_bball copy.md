Dear {first_name} ({nickname}),

Due to ongoing rain (predicted until ~19:00) in combination with the cold temperatures, we are forced to **cancel** today's Volleyball and Basketball events in order to prevent injuries.\
The Running/Sprints event will still take place, so feel free to join that (even if you're not officially signed up for it) if you want to follow your urge to move after work.

## Alternative

We are aware that you might already have planned the rest of your week, but for those who are available, we'll try to organize matches **this Friday** between 17:45 and 20:00 as the weather supposedly will be better then.

Since many of you are also involved in Foosball, Beer Pong or Ping Pong in that timeframe, we decided for the following format:

- We are just scheduling general slots for matches between the teams (A vs. B, B vs. C, C vs. A), more information will follow.
- We are not fixing the subteams.
- You may come to any of the match slots, but it will be first come-first-play (within the main teams), of course with prioritization for people who haven't yet played.
- Please prioritize your Foosball/Beer Pong/Ping Pong matches (in case you have any) and leave enough time for yourself to get to the venues as your opponents depend on them as well! You can come to Basketball/Volleyball before or after those.
- There are (outdoor) showers right next to the beach courts, and indoor ones at the institutes, in case you'll want to refresh before the party/award ceremony.

Weâ€™re super bummed we had to cancel for today, but we hope this alternative could work for some of you.
