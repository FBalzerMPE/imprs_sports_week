Dear {first_name},

thank you for filling out our survey concerning the inter-institute sports week, we're super excited to have you on board!
Please read the following carefully.

### General idea

By now, we have devised a more detailed plan for the events.\
For detailed information, we have also devised a website at [https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/](https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/).\
All participants are grouped into three main teams that send out players for each of the sports, enabling everyone to achieve points for their main team.

With this in mind, we have already set up sub-teams for each sport, and scheduled the matches, including the ones where **YOU** are planned to participate.\
You are going to be part of **{team_name}**.

It is therefore **really important** that you respond to this mail in case you can for whatever reason not be there to support your team. Please also respond with a brief confirmation if you can attend all just so we know you've received this mail.

You can find your schedule at the bottom of this mail.

### Nickname

To ensure anonymity, we have provided a nickname consisiting of *adjective + animal* for each player; your nickname is\
    **{nickname}**, we've attached your high-resolution avatar (Note that the attachment doesn't seem to be shown for all email programs, so let us know if we should resend it; roundcube seems to be a provider where it works).

This will allow you to review all of the details on the website as long as you remember the nickname or avatar.

### What else?

As a member of {team_name}, we ask you to try to wear *{cloth_color} clothing* during the events, although this is not mandatory. Also, make sure you read your sports' specifcations on what to bring; usually, it's just a water bottle and appropriate clothing, but e.g. tennis requires proper shoes.

**Be sure to briefly answer to this mail.**\
If you want to keep updates about the sports week, make sure to join our [Signal group, linked here]({signal_link}). This is of course optional.

We hope you're as excited for the sports week as we are!
