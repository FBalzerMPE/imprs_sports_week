Hi ...!

Since the inter-institute sports week is taking place next week already, we just wanted to make sure you're on board for your scheduled events (see the mail we sent out earlier, also attached below).

Please send a quick reply to this mail to let us know you're available!
This is valuable for us to properly plan the competitions.
Also drop us an email in case you have any questions, and tell us the sports you're not going to attend.

You may join the signal group for timely updates and a mapping between nicknames and real names.

See you in a week!
The organizing committee
Zsofi, Benny, Matteo, William, Fabi
