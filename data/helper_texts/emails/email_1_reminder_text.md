Dear {first_name},

thank you for signing up for the second inter-institute sports week!

Further information will follow soon, but for now we're still collecting the **2 € sign-up-fee**, which we believe you haven't paid yet.

Please either send the 2 € via PayPal to *fabian.balzer@outlook.com* ([https://www.paypal.me/FabianBalzer394](https://www.paypal.me/FabianBalzer394)), or give them in cash to one of the contact persons (there should be one at your institute):

    Tommy (ESO), Mari (IPP), Benny (MPA), Fabi (MPE), Sérgio (MPP), Adrien (MPQ), Leon (USM);

Their pictures can be found here: [https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/contact](https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/contact).

Please send the money **No later than this Sunday (April 13th)** as we want to finish the scheduling by then.

If you're somehow unable to pay any of us via the suggested methods, if you want to drop out of the sports week, or if you have already paid the fee and think this reminder is an error (apologies in that case), please just answer to this email.

We're looking forward to having you on board!

*Slight spoiler*: Your randomly-generated nickname on the website will be **{nickname}**, but further information (including your avatar) will follow with the rest of the scheduling information. Soon after we receive your payment, we'll update the status displayed on the [participants](https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/participants) part of the website.

The organizing committee

Zsofi, Benny, Matteo, William, Mari, Guillaume and Fabi
