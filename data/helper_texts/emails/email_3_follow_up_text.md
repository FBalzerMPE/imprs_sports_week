Hi {first_name} ({nickname})!

Since the inter-institute sports week is taking place next week already and we haven't yet received your confirmation, we wanted to make sure you're on board for your scheduled events. We've attached those below once again.

Please **send a quick reply to this mail to let us know you're available**!

This is super valuable for us to properly plan the competitions.
Also drop us an email in case you have any questions, and tell us in case there are sports you're not going to attend.\

You may also **join** our **[Signal group, linked here]({signal_link})** for timely updates.

Apologies if you had already confirmed your attendance, a few might have slipped through.

See you in a week!\
The organizing committee\
Zsofi, Benny, Matteo, William, Mari, Guillaume and Fabi
