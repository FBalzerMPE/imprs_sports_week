Dear {first_name} ({nickname}),

As you may have seen, the weather forecast for tomorrow predicts rain and cold temperatures.

We are still planning to have the Running/Sprints event take place, so please join Guillaume at around 17:45 at the location specified on the website (the TUM football and running fields).

It might be good to bring long-sleeved sports clothes as it might get a little cold.

See you tomorrow!
