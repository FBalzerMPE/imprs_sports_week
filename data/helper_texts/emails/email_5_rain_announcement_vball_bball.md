Dear {first_name} ({nickname}),

As you may have seen, the weather forecast for tomorrow unfortunately predicts rain and cold temperatures.

Because of this, we are **considering canceling** the Volleyball and Basketball events scheduled for tomorrow.\
A final decision will be made tomorrow based on the actual weather conditions (in case of very light rain, we might still try to make the best of it).

## What you need to know

- Please bring long-sleeved sports clothes, as the temperature is expected to be around 10°C.
- Check your email before coming! **If you don’t receive a cancellation email by 12:30 tomorrow, the events are going ahead as planned.**
- If we do cancel, we might try to reschedule some activities for Friday.

We’re really hoping the weather will be acceptable and we can see you tomorrow!

The Organizing Committee\
Zsofi, Benny, Matteo, William, Mari, Guillaume and Fabi
