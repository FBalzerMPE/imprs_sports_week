Dear {first_name} ({nickname}),

The rain today is predicted to last until ~19:00 o'clock - in case you'd prefer not to take part in the running/sprints event, we fully understand.\
We are going to organize it nonetheless for anyone interested, so please come if you feel like moving today :)

The Organizing Committee\
Zsofi, Benny, Matteo, William, Mari, Guillaume and Fabi
