Dear {first_name} ({nickname}),

After Monday has been pretty rainy, the weather is predicted to be a bit better on Tuesday.

We therefore think that we will be able to host the Football and Tennis events. What does that mean for you?

- Bring long-sleeved sports clothes as the temperatures are predicted to be on the cold side.
- Make sure you're at the venue (see the location tab for your sport on the [website](https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app)) at least 10 minutes prior to your matches (which you can find in the schedule tab), you won't want to make your teammates or opponents wait.
- Check your emails or the [signal group]({signal_link}) regularly as we will keep you updated that way - if it pours, we might be forced to cancel last minute (especially tennis might be sensitive to this).
- If you're spontaneously dropping out, please let us know so we can try to account for it!

See you tomorrow!
