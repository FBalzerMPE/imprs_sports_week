Dear {first_name} ({nickname}),

Thanks to your feedback, we were able to reschedule your badminton matches to work around the cancelled venue - again, sorry for this hassle!

Since you specified that you'd be available between 15:30 and 17:45, we have put you into the indoor slot at the gym in Garching (please check the location tab on the [website](https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/badminton) in advance and account for the time it takes to get there).

For this time slot, we have booked 3 courts. We have scheduled all 6 doubles for the first hour; in the second hour, you may schedule spontaneous additional matches. These can also be singles and won't be part of the overarching Sports Week point scheme.

Please see below for your updated schedule (for technical reasons we also list your other sports) - note that you might now be part of a different subteam in Badminton.

Let us know if there is anything left unclear!

The Organizing Committee\
Zsofi, Benny, Matteo, William, Mari, Guillaume and Fabi
