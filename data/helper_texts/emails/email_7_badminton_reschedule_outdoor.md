Dear {first_name} ({nickname}),

Thanks to your feedback, we were able to reschedule your badminton matches to work around the cancelled venue - again, sorry for this hassle!

Since you specified that you'd rather join the outdoor slot after working hours, we have scheduled you for that.

For this time slot, we have will provide three makeshift outdoor courts. We have scheduled all 6 doubles for the first hour after 18:00; afterwards, you may schedule spontaneous additional matches. These can also be singles and won't be part of the overarching Sports Week point scheme.

Please come to the TUM courts by 17:50 (see the location tab on the [website](https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/badminton)).

Unfortunately, there are now two Subteams in Team A who only have one scheduled match (as there were more dropouts for Teams B and C), so players in those will have priority for the free matches afterwards.

Please see below for your updated schedule (for technical reasons we also list your other sports) - note that you might now be part of a different subteam in Badminton.

Let us know if there is anything left unclear!

The Organizing Committee\
Zsofi, Benny, Matteo, William, Mari, Guillaume and Fabi
