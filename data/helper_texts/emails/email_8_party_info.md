Hey {first_name} ({nickname})!

Here's a bunch of information concerning Friday, the final day of the Sports Week. This includes an update for Volleyball/Basketball!\
This is also a reminder to join the [Signal Group]({signal_link}) if you haven't done so already - it is be the best way to stay up-to-date.

### The Party

The Sports Week has been an absolute blast so far. And it's all thanks to the amazing energy you’ve brought!

But the big question still remains... Who will lift the world-renowned Sports Week trophy?

Will it be **Team A**, defending their title from last year? Or will **Team B** or **Team C** claim their first-ever victory in History?
Truth will be told soon and we’ll celebrate in style!

Join us for the big Sports Week Party this Friday night in MPA’s common room with

- 🎶 Great tunes
- 🍿 Snacks
- 🍻 Beers & cocktails for just 1 € each
- 🎉 Great vibes all evening, starting from around 19 o'clock!
- 🏆 The big **Award Ceremony** happening at around **21:45** to kick off the after-party!

To attend, you don't even need to be signed up for anything, but if you play Foosball or Beer Pong, you'll be in the middle of it anyways.

### 🏀🏐 Basketball and Volleyball

As you might know, we needed to cancel the Basketball and Volleyball events on Monday on short notice. As an alternative, we have devised the following [also relevant for people originally not signed up!]:

- We have scheduled general matches for Friday between the main teams.
- **EVERYONE** (even the ones not signed up for Volleyball/Basketball) is welcome to play in these, however:
  1. If you have conflicting matches in Beer Pong, Foosball, or Ping Pong, they should have priority! Plan for at least 10 minutes of transition time between the venues.
  2. Once you have played a match, you might need to make space for other people that haven't played so far - it's gonna be first come, first serve with a queueing system.
  3. The start times of the matches can be found in the schedule tabs on the [website](https://sports-week-garching.streamlit.app/basketball).
  4. When you take part in a match, be sure to write down your nickname.

### 💥🍺 Foosball and Beer Pong

- Please ensure to be at your venues in time! The path to MPA is on the location tabs, if you go downstairs, you should find the places by just walking around and following the noise.

Let's wrap up Sports Week the right way, we're looking forward to an intense final day! Until then, see you at the other events.
