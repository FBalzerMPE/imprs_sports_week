At the time of writing these questions, they luckily haven't been frequently asked, but let's hope they help to shed some light on things that might not be clear.

### I have signed up for way more sports than I am now scheduled. Why?

To ensure a good flow during the events, we set up the schedules in ways to avoid overlaps for players, if you e.g. signed up for Basketball and Volleyball (which both take place on Monday), you will be scheduled as reserve for at least one of them. For all events except for Ping Pong, Foosball, Spikeball, and Tennis, that means that you may substitute in in whichever subteam you choose.\
This way, you are more flexible, and you won't encounter stressful duble-bookings.

### Why all this hassle with the big teams and subteams? How does the scoring system work?

We have opted for this way of organizing the sports week as it offers advantages for planning the events, and builds an overarching for the whole week. You can look at <a href="Statistics" target="_self">the statistics page</a> for more information on how they were built from the survey results.\
For each sport, every team can reach a certain score (how exactly is specified in the *Format* section on each page). These scores are mapped to a scale of 0 to 10 each, and finally summed up. This ensures that each sport will be weighted equally in the end, and every contribution counts.

### Can I reschedule one of my ping pong matches?

Since ping pong is going to take place during the whole week and some of the slots are somewhat late, we allow you to easily reschedule a match, even to times not specified in our schedule - as long as your opponent agrees to it and the table you're opting for is available, you're free to find your own time.

If you want to play during some of the main times, please first look at the general schedule and find a time and table that is not taken.\
After you've settled for a new time and place, please send Zsofi or Fabi an email (preferably with your opponent in cc), or a signal message.

### I cannot make it on one of the days, can I still attend on the others?

Sure, just ensure you've notified us about any matches that you need to drop out of.
