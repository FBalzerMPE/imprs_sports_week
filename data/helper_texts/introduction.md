## Information concerning sign-ups

This is the quick version with the most important info for the upcoming sports week between May 5th and May 9th (scroll down for further details):

- Make sure to sign up no later than SIGNUP_DEADLINE if you want a guaranteed spot in most sports you desire!
- Make sure to also pay the 2 ‚Ç¨ participation fee until then (see below for why we've decided to introduce it).
- If you haven't received a mail with access to the survey to sign up, write a mail to one of the organizers (see <a href="contact" target="_self">here</a>).

## Spirit of the Sports Week

On this website you can find up-to-date information for you to participate in second **Inter-Institute Sports Week on the Garching campus**.

What is this week about? Mostly, we aim to have loads of fun by competing in a bunch of different disciplines by having mixed teams consisting of PhDs, PostDocs and other interested students from Munich institutes (USM, MPE, MPA, MPP, MPQ, ESO, and IPP).

Every day after work from around **5:30 - 8:30 pm** in the week from **May 5th to May 9th** you will have the chance to take part in a variety of sports.
Doing so you can score points for your big teams (see below), of which one will ultimately be crowned winner!\
However, the main goal is to get some movement into our lives (not just sitting at the desk all day!), try some new sports, have fun as a team and meet new people!

## How does it work?

By now, you should have received an email with a survey for participation to be filled out, as well as a request to pay the 2 ‚Ç¨ participation fee.\
If you haven't received the survey but would like to participate, drop us an email.\
Please fill out this survey until no later than SIGNUP_DEADLINE to give us some time to plan accordingly!

### Sign-up fee

This year we require a registration fee of 2 Euros (in total, regardless of amount of sports you want to participate in).
Last year we received limited funding (order of 40 ‚Ç¨) from the IMPRS Common Room, but since the event has expanded to other institutes that are not part of IMPRS, we ask for this small fee to enable us to get: 

- Ice packs and first aid material.
- Necessary sports equipment (we're thinking of getting some bibs).
- Snacks and drinks for the Sports Week Party on Friday, May 9th.

### What we'll do with the survey data

This survey will allow us to group all participants into **three or four main teams** that are roughly equal-sized with respect to every sport - we'll decide on team sizes depending on the number of sign-ups, last year there were more than 100 participants split into 3 main teams!\
The idea is that these teams send out their **Champions** (sometimes grouped into smaller subteams) for each of the sports, in which they can work together to achieve points for the main team.\
At the end of the week, we are going to celebrate the winners (and all participants) in a big party.

To track the results of the events publicly without exposing your names, we have decided to give each participant a randomized nickname consisting of an adjective and animal name.

## The sports

You can find a general schedule <a href="schedule" target="_self">here</a>, while a detailed one including more information (especially locations and **rules**) on each of the sports can be found on their respective sites.

In short, we offer the following sports:
MONDAY_LINKS
TUESDAY_LINKS
WEDNESDAY_LINKS
THURSDAY_LINKS
FRIDAY_LINKS

On the final *Friday* (May 9th) there's also the award ceremony and closing party.\
Since a whole lot of people are usually interested in playing ping pong, we decided to have matches for this throughout the whole week.
PING_PONG_LINK

## The teams

Soon you will be able to find the main teams' participants <a href="teams" target="_self">here</a>.\
These teams will be composed having an equal number of players for each sport in mind, while also mixing up the institutes quite a bit.\
Unfortunately, this means that you might not be in a team with your best buddy, but on the bright side, that way you might be able to face them in competition!
You can find last year's teams in their dedicated tab, see <a href="previous_sports_weeks" target="_self">here</a>.

### What to compete for üèÜ

First and foremost, we want to encourage fun competitions.
The team with the best overall performance across all of the sports might receive something else, so make sure to stay tuned for the award ceremony on **Friday, May 9th, at 21:00** in front of the **MPA common room**!\
More information on that might follow, most likely via the Signal group chat to which you should receive an invitation via email.

### Results

You will be able to find daily-updated results <a href="statistics" target="_self">in the results tab</a> soon.

### Scheduling process and statistics

For the nerds amongst you we've laid out how we are generating the (sub- and main) teams and each sport's schedules <a href="statistics" target="_self">here</a>; in short, they are chosen almost completely randomly while trying to have an equal number of players for each sport. We've only made minor adjustments to account for cases where our algorithm failed.

## Late sign-ups

If you are interested in joining but missed the deadline of SIGNUP_DEADLINE, simply write a mail to Fabi or any of the other organizing committee members, stating the sports you'd like to participate in. Please make sure you'll be available on the days these are taking place!\
We'll then assign you to the main team fitting these sports best, and register you as a reserve player for each of the sports. For Spikeball, Foosball, Tennis, or Ping Pong, that means that you may be assigned in place of any player that drops out; for the other sports, you may attend as a substitute player.

## Questions?

If there is anything left unclear or you have feedback, feel free to read our <a href="statistics" target="_self">FAQ</a> or to contact us!
See <a href="contact" target="_self">here</a> for an overview of the responsible people for each sport.

We're anticipating loads of sore muscles and fun memories!
