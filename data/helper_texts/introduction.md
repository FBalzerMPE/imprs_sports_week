Hello you!\
If you came here searching for further information concerning the first **Inter-Institute Sports Week**, you're certainly on the right *track*.\
What was this week about again? Mostly, we aim to have loads of fun by competing in a bunch of different disciplines, having mixed teams consisting of PhDs and PostDocs from all Munich astro institutes (USM, MPE, MPA, ESO), as well as our neighbors from IPP and MPP.

Every day after work from around **5:30 - 8:30 pm** you will be offered to take part in a variety of sports in order to win points and ultimately be crowned winners! However, the main goal is to get some movement into our lives (not just sitting at the desk all day!), try something new, have fun in a team and meet new people!

## How does it work?

A few weeks ago, we asked you to fill out a survey with the sports you're interested in.\
While we do enjoy gathering data just for fun, this survey allowed us to group all of you into **three main teams** that are roughly equal-sized with respect to every sport.\
The idea is that these main teams send out their **Champions** (sometimes grouped into smaller sub-teams) for each of the sports, in which they can achieve glory and points for the main team.\
At the end of the week, we are going to celebrate the winners (and all participants) in a big party.

To track the results of the events publicly without exposing your names, we decided to give each of you a randomized nickname consisting of an adjective and animal name.
