As the forecast does not predict any rain for today, the Spikeball and outdoor Badminton matches are going to take place as planned. Please try to arrive at least 10 minutes prior to your matches, the location can be found in the location tab (TUM pitches, where also the football took place).

We advise you to bring long-sleeved clothing as the temperatures are expected to be around 10¬∞C.

## Spirit of the Sports Week

What is this week about? Mostly, we aim to have loads of fun by competing in a bunch of different disciplines. For this, we mix three big teams consisting of PhDs, PostDocs and other interested students from Munich/Garching institutes (USM, MPE, MPA, MPP, MPQ, ESO, and IPP).

Currently, there are an astounding **NUM_SIGNUPS** people that have signed up, competing in NUM_MATCHES scheduled matches within the NUM_EVENTS different sports, organized by ~NUM_ORGANIZERS people across the institutes - if you missed the sign-up deadline, scroll all the way down for more information concerning late signups.

Every day after work from around **5:30 - 8:30 pm** in the week from **May 5th to May 9th** you will have the chance to take part in a variety of sports.
Doing so you can score points for your big teams, of which one will ultimately be crowned winner!\
However, the main goal is to get some movement into our lives (not just sitting at the desk all day!), try some new sports, have fun as a team and meet new people!

## How does it work?

PostDocs, PhDs and master's students across the participating institutes have been invited via an initial email which contained a link to the survey. From the results of this survey, we generated **three main teams** that are roughly equal-sized with respect to every sport - we'll decide on team sizes depending on the number of sign-ups, last year there were more than 100 participants split into 3 main teams!\
The idea is that these teams send out their **Champions** (sometimes grouped into smaller subteams) for each of the sports, in which they can work together to achieve points for the main team.\
At the end of the week, we are going to celebrate the winners (and all participants) in a big party.

To track the results of the events publicly without exposing your names, we have decided to give each participant a randomized nickname consisting of an adjective and animal name.

## The sports

You can find a general schedule <a href="schedule" target="_self">here</a>, while a detailed one including more information (especially locations and **rules**) on each of the sports can be found on their respective sites.

In short, we offer the following sports:
MONDAY_LINKS
TUESDAY_LINKS
WEDNESDAY_LINKS
THURSDAY_LINKS
FRIDAY_LINKS

On the final *Friday* (May 9th) there's also the award ceremony and closing party.\
Since a whole lot of people are usually interested in playing ping pong, we decided to have matches for this throughout the whole week.
PING_PONG_LINK

## The teams

You can find all participants and the three teams at the following locations:
TEAM_LINKS
These teams have been composed to have an equal number of players for each sport, while also mixing up the institutes quite a bit.\
Unfortunately, this means that you might not be in a team with your best buddy, but on the bright side, that way you are able to face them in competition!
You can find last year's teams in their dedicated tab, see <a href="previous_sports_weeks" target="_self">here</a>.

### What to compete for üèÜ

First and foremost, we want to encourage fun competitions.
The team with the best overall performance across all of the sports might receive something else, so make sure to stay tuned for the award ceremony on **Friday, May 9th, at 21:00** in front of the **MPA common room**!\
More information on that might follow, most likely via the Signal group chat to which you should receive an invitation via email.

### Results

You will be able to find daily-updated results <a href="statistics" target="_self">in the results tab</a> soon.

### Scheduling process and statistics

For the nerds amongst you we've laid out how we are generating the (sub- and main) teams and each sport's schedules <a href="statistics" target="_self">here</a>; in short, they are chosen almost completely randomly while trying to have an equal number of players for each sport. We've only made minor adjustments to account for cases where our algorithm failed.

### Sign-up fee

This year we require a registration fee of 2 Euros (in total, regardless of amount of sports you want to participate in).
Last year we received limited funding (order of 40 ‚Ç¨, which was barely enough) from the IMPRS Common Room and paid part of the equipment ourselves. Since the event has expanded to other institutes that are not part of IMPRS, this time around we thus ask for this small fee to enable us to get: 

- Ice packs and first aid material.
- Necessary sports equipment (we're thinking of acquiring some bibs).
- Snacks and drinks for the Sports Week Party on Friday, May 9th.

## :warning: Information concerning late sign-ups

You've missed the deadline but would still like to participate? No problem!

- Even though the teams are already built at this point, if you fill in the survey (which you should have received via email), we'll schedule you as a reserve player in the sports you are interested in (but please make sure you'd be available).\
It is **very likely** that you'll then be called upon soon to jump in for drop-outs.
- You'll only have to pay the 2 ‚Ç¨ participation fee if you are actually scheduled for any of the sports.
If you are interested in joining but missed the deadline of SIGNUP_DEADLINE, simply write a mail to Fabi or any of the other organizing committee members, stating the sports you'd like to participate in. Please make sure you'll be available on the days these are taking place!\
