Hello you!\
If you came here searching for further information concerning the first **Inter-Institute Sports Week**, you're certainly on the right track.\
What was this week about again? Mostly, we aim to have loads of fun by competing in a bunch of different disciplines, having mixed teams consisting of PhDs and PostDocs from Munich institutes (USM, MPE, MPA, ESO, and IPP).

Every day after work from around **5:30 - 8:30 pm** in the week from **April 29th to May 3rd** you will be offered to take part in a variety of sports in order to win points and ultimately be crowned winners! However, the main goal is to get some movement into our lives (not just sitting at the desk all day!), try something new, have fun in a team and meet new people!

## How does it work?

A few weeks ago, we asked you to fill out a survey with the sports you're interested in.\
*If you missed this survey, you may still participate, see down below at late sign-ups!*\
While we do enjoy gathering data just for fun, this survey allowed us to group all of you into **three main teams** that are roughly equal-sized with respect to every sport - there were more than 90 sign-ups!\
The idea is that these main teams send out their **Champions** (sometimes grouped into smaller sub-teams) for each of the sports, in which they can achieve glory and points for the main team.\
At the end of the week, we are going to celebrate the winners (and all participants) in a big party.

To track the results of the events publicly without exposing your names, we decided to give each of you a randomized nickname consisting of an adjective and animal name.

## The sports

You can find a general schedule <a href="Schedule" target="_self">here</a>, while a detailed one including more information (especially locations and **rules**) on each of the sports can be found on their respective sites.

In short, we offer\
MONDAY_LINKS on *Monday*,\
TUESDAY_LINKS
on *Tuesday*,\
THURSDAY_LINKS
on *Thursday* (we skip Wednesday to have a well-deserved day to rest a bit), and\
FRIDAY_LINKS
on the final *Friday*.\
Since there were a whopping 52 people interested in PING_PONG_LINK, we decided to have matches for this throughout the whole week.

## The teams

You can find the three main teams' participants <a href="Teams" target="_self">here</a>.\
These teams are composed having an equal number of players for each sport in mind, while also mixing up the institutes quite a bit.\
Unfortunately, this means that you might not be in a team with your best buddy, but on the bright side, that means that you might be able to face them in competition!

### What to compete for üèÜ

Most importantly, we want to encourage fun competitions.
The team with the best performance across all of the sports might receive something else, so make sure to stay tuned for the award ceremony on **Friday, 21:00** at the **MPA seminar room**!\
More information on that might follow, most likely via the Signal group chat.

### Results

You can find daily-updated results <a href="Results and Statistics" target="_self">here</a>.

### Scheduling process and statistics

For the nerds amongst you we've laid out how we generated the (sub- and main) teams and each sport's schedules <a href="Results and Statistics" target="_self">here</a>; in short, they are chosen almost completely randomly, we've only made minor adjustments to account for cases where our algorithm failed.

## Late sign-ups

If you are interested in joining but missed the deadline, simply write a mail to Fabi or any of the other organizing committee members, stating the sports you'd like to participate in, and the days you're available.\
We'll then assign you to the team fitting these sports best, and register you as a reserve player for each of the sports. For Spikeball, Foosball, Tennis, or Ping Pong, that means that you may be assigned in place of any player that drops out; for the other sports, you may attend as a substitute player.

## Questions?

If there is anything left unclear or you have feedback, feel free to read our <a href="FAQ" target="_self">FAQ</a> or to contact us!
See <a href="Contact" target="_self">here</a> for an overview of the responsible people for each sport.

We're anticipating loads of sore muscles and fun memories!
