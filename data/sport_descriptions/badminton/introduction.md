‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èDue to a last-minute cancellation by the venue, the Badminton event will not take place as initially scheduled.

We will instead have a slot during working hours (indoors), and one at the initial time (outdoors), for which schedules will follow soon.

Upon several requests, we've decided to add Badminton to our roster of sports!\
Fast, Fun, and Featherlight - Grace meets speed in this exhilarating game! Whether you're just going for friendly rallys or smashing your way to victory, this dynamic sport is perfect for all skill levels. Grab a racket, feel the thrill of quick reflexes and sharp strategy, and let the shuttle soar in this fun and energetic event! üè∏‚ú®.

**‚ö†Ô∏èIf you own Badminton rackets and shuttles (and haven't told us in the survey), let us (ORGANIZERS) know and bring them for the event!**
