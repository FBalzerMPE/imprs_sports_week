‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èDue to a last-minute cancellation by the venue, the Badminton event will not take place as initially scheduled:
We will instead have one slot during working hours (indoors), and one at the initial time (outdoors).‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Each of these slots is planned to be an hour of scheduled games of doubles, plus an hour of free-play in which you can organize your own matches.

Upon several requests, we've decided to add Badminton to our roster of sports!\
Fast, Fun, and Featherlight - Grace meets speed in this exhilarating game! Whether you're just going for friendly rallys or smashing your way to victory, this dynamic sport is perfect for all skill levels. Grab a racket, feel the thrill of quick reflexes and sharp strategy, and let the shuttle soar in this fun and energetic event! üè∏‚ú®.

**‚ö†Ô∏èIf you own Badminton rackets and shuttles (and haven't told us in the survey), let us (ORGANIZERS) know and bring them for the event!**
