We will provide a ruleset soon.


<!-- 1. Each match consists of best-of-five sets (i.e. the first player to win three sets wins).
2. Players score points by their opponents committing faults (i.e. not returning the ball in the correct way, touching the ball with their racket twice, or receiving the opponents ball above the table without it having touched it).
3. The ball must bounce once on your side before being returned.
4. Serving alternates between players after every two points, with the initial serve being determined via a *Sprungdie* (see advanced rules), and then alternating for each set.
5. The first player or team to reach 11 points with a 2-point lead wins a set. In case of a tie at 10 points, play continues until one player has a 2-point lead.
6. Players must adhere to service rules (see also advanced rules).

### Advanced rules

1. **Initial Serve**: The first serve of a game is determined via a so-called *Sprungdie*, which means that the ball is initially thrown in, the player's feet need to be in the air every time their racket touches the ball. The player winning this rally (after it has been returned at least once) gets to decide who can perform the initial serve. For the sets following the first one, the starting serve is alternated.
2. **Serving**: A serve must first bounce on the server's side of the table, then on the other side; the quarter of the table doesn't matter (i.e. serves do not have to be diagonal). For a serve, the server has to first announce the score. Then, the ball needs to be tossed up before being hit by one's racket.\
We'll be lenient; Throwing the ball up and catching it again is not considered a fault here, although we ask you to not abuse this. -->
