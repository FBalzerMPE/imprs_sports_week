We use the Standard Badminton ruleset (more or less), mainly driven by the time constraints:

Each match is 20 minutes approximately, and is a single set. A second set can be started if time allows it (Max 25 mins, 5 for warm up).

One set is won at 21 points with at least 2 points more than the other team. Point ceiling is set at 30 for time constraints.
Service is decided with a toss, winning a point gives your team the service.

You switch sides when the first team reach 11 points.

We need to clean and leave the indoor venue at 5:30 pm, free play can be set up after the second set of double matches (from 4:45 pm to the end).
