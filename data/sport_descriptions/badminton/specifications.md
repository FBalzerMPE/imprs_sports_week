### General

- Matches will be played on one of the three nets we provide for the IPP field, although we are also exploring the possibility of being able to play indoors.
- It is not yet decided whether we are going to play doubles or singles.

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning subteam, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

### What to bring

You do not need to bring any special equipment, but make sure to not forget your water bottle!
