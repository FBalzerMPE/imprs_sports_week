### General

- We managed to book an indoor court at a place in Garching (see location tab)! This means that you're **expected to bring indoor shoes with a white sole**! You will not be allowed in without those.
- Please factor in the time it takes to get there (~20 min from the Garching campus)
- We have 6 courts at our disposal.
- We decided to schedule doubles to give everyone the chance to play; each big team will send out NUM_SUBTEAMS, which will play 2 matches each.
- If everything goes to plan, we'll be finished with those matches by ~19:15 - afterwards, you can spontaneously schedule 1v1 matches with whomever you wish to play.

### What to bring

- ⚠️You **ARE REQUIRED TO BRING INDOOR SHOES**.
- If you have them, please bring your badminton rackets and shuttles.
- Also make sure to not forget your water bottle!

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning subteam, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.
