### General

- The matches are taking place on the LOCATION, one match at a time.
- Each main team provides NUM_SUBTEAMS subteam consisting of NUM_PLAYERS_SUBTEAM players, along with some reserve players.
- Thus, each subteam will have two matches in total.
- During play, 4 players per main team are allowed to be on the court.

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning team, 0.5 for each team in the case of a tie, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, these are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

### What to bring

You do not need to bring any special equipment, but make sure to not forget your water bottle!\
A sporty attire might of course also be good.
