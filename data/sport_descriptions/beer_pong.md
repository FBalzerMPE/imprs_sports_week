Ah, the majestic sport of beer pong — a sacred game that combines the elegance of Olympic sports, such as the accuracy of an archer, with the, uh, delightful consumption of adult beverages. A fierce battle wherein friendships are forged, tested, and sometimes broken, all in the name of friendly competition of course. Your mission? To sink shots like a pro and outwit your opponents with dazzling trick shots as victory tastes sweet and defeat... well, also tastes kind of sweet because, hey, you're still drinking beer. However, amidst the laughter and noble tradition of trash-talking with flair, there exist rules — yes, rules — to ensure fairness and a reasonable level of chaos.

## Rule System for Embracing the Pong

### 1: Set Up Your Battlefield

- Table: Suitable tables will be available in the MPA common room.
- Cup Formation: Per team, arrange ten cups in pyramid shape (4,3,2,1) and align them with the pyramid tip towards the center of the table pointing away from you. Each cup should be filled to ~1/4 with water.  
- Balls: 2 ping pong balls are required.
- Beer: Every player requires a full 0.5L bottle of beer.

### 2: BASICS (SHORT VERSION)

- Every player on a team throws one ball per round
- Hit cups must be drunk in form of chugging a single cup contents worth of beer from a bottle
- The elbow must always stay behind the edge of the table when throwing
- If both players hit, the team may throw again ("Balls Back")
- The teams take turns throwing
- When the last cup has been hit, the team has another counter attack
- The team hits the counterattack: game is a draw.
- If both players hit the same cup, 3 cups are put away ("Bomb")
- If a player announces a stand-alone cup, 2 cups are put away ("Island")

### 3: Slaying the Cup

Both team members try to throw a ball into the opposing team's cups per round. If a cup is hit, its eqivalent must be drunk *after* both balls have been thrown. Balls must always be removed from the cups immediately. The team that hits all of the opposing team's cups first wins.

Make sure to check the advanced rules down below.

## Format and location

- As stated above, we'll aim for two tables at the MPA common room.
- Each subteam consists of 3 players, there are 3 subteams per main team.
- 3 points are awarded to each winning team, and 0 for a loss. At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed and normalized to determine the contribution to the main team's score.
- We trust the teams to keep things civil by themselves, but Benny and William will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

### Advanced rules

#### BALLS BACK

If both team members meet in the same round, the team receives the balls back and is allowed to throw again. The cups are removed before the second throw.

#### REARRANGE

During the course of the game, players may request that the opposing team rearrange their cups back into a requested shape once.

#### PICK UP / BLOW AWAY

If a player throws the ball with a bouncer on the table top, the opposing team must drink two cups. In order to avoid landing, the ball may be knocked away or caught *after* the first contact with the table. If a ball is still circling around in a mug and has not yet touched the water, it can be blown out

#### TRICKSHOT

If a player throws the ball and it rolls back over the table to their own side and is caught (without touching the ground), it is the thrower's turn again. The throw has to be a trick shot. Means: close your eyes / with your left / behind your back / etc

#### BOMB

If both team members meet in the same cup, the "bomb" rule applies. 3 cups are removed from the opposing side and the team receives both balls back (balls back) and is allowed to throw again.

#### ISLAND

This rule can be used by each player once in the game. If a cup stands alone (without touching others), the player can refer to "Island" on the cup. If the named cup is hit, the shooter may choose a second cup for the opponents to drink. However, if the player accidentally hits another cup, the hit will not count.

#### AIRBALL

Every time a player over shoots the end of the table with their throw, this counts as airball. For every set of 3 airballs, the team must drink and rempove one of its own cups.
