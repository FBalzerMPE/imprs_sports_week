### General

- As stated above, we'll aim for two tables at the LOCATION.
- Each subteam consists of NUM_PLAYERS_PER_SUBTEAM players, there are NUM_SUBTEAMS subteams per main team.
- Each subteam will play two matches.

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning subteam, 0.5 for each subteam in the case of a tie, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to keep things civil by themselves, but ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.
