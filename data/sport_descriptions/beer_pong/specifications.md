### General

- As stated above, we'll aim for two tables at the MPA seminar room.
- Each subteam consists of 3 players, there are 3 subteams per main team.

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning subteam, 0.5 for each subteam in the case of a tie, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of **1.5** to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to keep things civil by themselves, but Benny and William will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.
