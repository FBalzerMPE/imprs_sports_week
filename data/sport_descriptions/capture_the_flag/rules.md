1. Each match will consist of best-of-three rounds.
2. A team wins a round by successfully capturing the opponent's flag from the neutral zone and returning it to their territory without being tagged.
3. Players tagged by opponents in the enemy part of the field will be temporarily immobilized ("frozen") and cannot actively participate in the game.
4. To free a frozen teammate, a member of their team must touch them to allow them to resume play.
5. A round ends when one of the teams successfully captures the opponent's flag and brings it back to their part of the field, or when the designated time for the round expires.

See below for some advanced rules.

### Advanced rules

The following should clarify most edge cases, so please read carefully if you're a rules nerd and want to not commit any accidental faults.

1. When a team member decides to leave the neutral zone to return the flag to their own half of the field, it must always remain visible. Therefore, hiding the flag, e.g., under clothing, is prohibited.
2. A team member who has been immobilized near the neutral zone or their own half of the field can be freed by forming a human chain of up to two people of their team (excluding the immobilized player), with one of the two individuals having at least one foot in their own half of the field or the neutral zone.
3. Passing the flag to a teammate is allowed, but throwing it is not permitted. Doing so is considered a fault. In this case, the game stops and the flag has be to returned to the opponent's neutral zone before resuming the round.
