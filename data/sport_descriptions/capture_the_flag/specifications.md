### General

- The field will be divided into two territories, one for each team, with a neutral zone behind each team's territory in which the flag is initially placed.
- Players entering the opponent's neutral zone cannot be tagged by opponents.
- There will be one subteam per main team, consisting of 8 players.
- Each subteam will play two matches in total, one against a different main team's subteam.

### Point scheme

3 points are awarded to each winning team. At the end, all points the teams have achieved are summed and normalized to determine the contribution to the total main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but Benny and Zsofi will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

### What to bring

You do not need to bring any special equipment, but make sure to not forget your water bottle!

Get ready to immerse yourself in the thrilling world of Capture the Flag and demonstrate your courage and strategic prowess on the playing field. Have fun to all participants!
