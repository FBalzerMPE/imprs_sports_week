Welcome to the Chess event of our Sports Week!\
Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. Prepare yourself for fast paced battle of wits!\
Here is everything you need to know:

## Rules

We will follow the standard FIDE ruleset you can read [here](https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/LawsOfChess.pdf).

- The games will be played in rapid time format 15 + 10 (15 minutes for each player plus 10 seconds increment each turn). Accordingly moves will not be recorded.

If possible please pre-install it. In addition David will provide his phone as a clock if needed.
- Each team will send out three players, every player will play one player of each opposing main team.
- Points will be awarded as explained in the FIDE ruleset: 1 points for a win, 1/2 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss, and then normalized to contribute to the main team's scores.
