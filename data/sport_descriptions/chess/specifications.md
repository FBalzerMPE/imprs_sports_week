### General

- We will play at the MPA seminar room 006 (the one close to the MPA common room).
- The games will be played in rapid time format 15 + 10 (15 minutes for each player plus 10 seconds increment each turn). Accordingly moves will not be recorded.
- As a clock we will use the app **"Chess Clock"** provided by chess.com (e.g. [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chess-clock-by-chess-com/id858039162) for iOS or [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chess.clock) in the play store). If possible please pre-install it. In addition David will provide his phone as a clock if needed.
- Each main team will send out NUM_SUBTEAMS players, every player will play one player of each opposing main team.

### Point scheme

Points will be awarded as explained in the FIDE ruleset: 1 points for a win, 1/2 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss.\
At the end, these are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

During the tournament, ORGANIZERS will be present for questions and to arbitrate.
