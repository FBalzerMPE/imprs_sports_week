You can still rack up your team some precious points with a touch of finesse and some good ol' handwork. What are you waiting for? Grab your partner, grab a drink, and let the final games begin!

## Duration of each match

- 15 minutes sharp, or the winning condition is reached by one of the teams.

## Rules

1. No spinning.
2. After each goal the kickoff is from the center, performed by the team that scored the goal.
3. The first team that reaches 10 goals with minimum difference of 2 goals wins the game.
4. After 10 goals the minimum difference of 2 still applies unless time runs out, in which case if the teams are tied the first team that scores wins.

Feel free to ask Matteo G if there's anything unclear.
