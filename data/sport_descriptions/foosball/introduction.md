Aficionados of the beautiful game and soccer-curious amigos, welcome to the Sport Week's OG Foosball Page!
Prepare to lace up your cleats, dust off your training shoes... wait a second! It's friday night!

You can still rack up your team some precious points with a touch of finesse and some good ol' handwork. What are you waiting for? Grab your partner, grab a drink, and let the final games begin!
