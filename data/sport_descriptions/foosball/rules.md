There's hopefully not much to explain here, we just follow the usual play style. However, let' specify a few things:

1. After 15 minutes sharp, the game will end in a tie if no winning condition is met by one of the teams.
2. No spinning.
3. After each goal the kickoff is from the center, performed by the team that scored the goal.
4. The first team that reaches 10 goals with minimum difference of 2 goals wins the game.
5. After 10 goals the minimum difference of 2 still applies unless time runs out, in which case if the teams are tied the first team that scores wins.
