### General

- We are aiming to play at two foosball tables set up close to LOCATION.
- Each main team provides NUM_SUBTEAMS consisting of NUM_PLAYERS_SUBTEAM players.
- Each subteam will have two matches in total.

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning team, 0.5 for each team in the case of a tie, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, these are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may voice their opinions over any disputes.
