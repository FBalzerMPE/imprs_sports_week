### General

The games will take place at the Foosball table in the MPA common room.

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning team, 0.5 for each team in the case of a tie, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, these are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of **1.5** to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but Matteo will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may voice their opinions over any disputes.
