### General

The games will take place at the Foosball table in the MPA common room.

### Point scheme

3 points are awarded to each winning subteam, 1 for a tie, and 0 for a loss. At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed and normalized to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but Matteo will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may voice their opinions over any disputes.
