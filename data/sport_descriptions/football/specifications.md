### General

- We are aiming to play at LOCATION.
- Each main team provides NUM_SUBTEAMS consisting of NUM_PLAYERS_SUBTEAM players (might be subject to change), along with some reserve players.
- Each subteam will have two matches in total.

### Duration

Each match slot is structured as follows:

- Be there early for 5 minutes of warm up
- 2x10 minutes with a 5 minute break in between
- 5 minutes of break between successive games

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning team, 0.5 for each team in the case of a tie, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, these are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee the games.

We're looking forward to having some unforgettable, fun and fair matches!
