### General

- We are aiming to play on the big IPP pitch.
- Each main team provides one subteam consisting of 10 players (might be subject to change), along with some reserve players.
- Thus, each subteam will have two matches in total.

### Duration

Each match slot is structured as follows:

- 5 minutes of warm up
- 2x15 minutes with a 5 minute break in between
- 5 minutes of break between successive games

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning team, 0.5 for each team in the case of a tie, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, these are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of **1.5** to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

Matteo will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee the games.

We're looking forward to having some unforgettable, fun and fair matches!
