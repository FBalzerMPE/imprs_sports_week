Welcome to the Ping Pong event of our Sports Week! Get ready to unleash your precision and finesse on the table as you engage in thrilling matches against your opponents. Here's everything you need to know:

## General Idea

Ping Pong, also known as Table Tennis, is a fast-paced and exhilarating sport played between two players or two teams of two players each. The objective is to score points by hitting a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small paddles. It's a game of lightning-fast reflexes, strategic positioning, and pinpoint accuracy.

## Rules

1. Each match consists of best-of-five sets (i.e. the first player to win three sets wins).
2. Players score points by successfully hitting the ball over the net onto the opponent's side of the table, causing them to commit a fault.
3. The ball must bounce once on your side before being returned.
4. Serving alternates between players after every two points, with the initial serve being determined via a *Sprungdie* (see advanced rules), and then alternating for each set.
5. The first player or team to reach 11 points with a 2-point lead wins a set. In case of a tie at 10 points, play continues until one player has a 2-point lead.
6. Players must adhere to service rules (see also advanced rules).

## Format

- Matches will be played on the table in the MPE common room.
- Each match will involve two players. You may contact your opponent prior to the sports week to reschedule the match (even during a lunch break), but please write a mail to Zsofi or Fabi in this case.
- Each player forms a subteam and will play two matches, one against a different main team's player.
- 3 points are awarded to the winner of a match. At the end, all points a main team's players have achieved are summed and normalized to determine the contribution to the main team's score.
- Since table tennis matches are going to take part during the whole week, there won't be referees available at all times. We ask you to count the points fairly and report the score afterwards via sending a mail or signal message to Fabi. If there is any dispute, just repeat the point - we're all here to have fun!
- You do not need to bring any special equipment as there are rackets and ping pong balls in the common room, but you may of course bring your own racket.

Get ready to showcase your agility, precision, and tactical prowess on the ping pong table. Good luck to all participating players and teams!

## Advanced rules

1. **Initial Serve**: The first serve of a game is determined via a so-called *Sprungdie*, which means that the ball is initially thrown in, the player's feet need to be in the air every time their racket touches the ball. The player winning this rally (after it has been returned at least once) gets to decide who can perform the initial serve. For the sets following the first one, the starting serve is alternated.
2. **Serving**: A serve must first bounce on the server's side of the table, then on the other side; the quarter of the table doesn't matter (i.e. serves do not have to be diagonal). For a serve, the server has to first announce the score. Then, the ball needs to be tossed up before being hit by one's racket.
