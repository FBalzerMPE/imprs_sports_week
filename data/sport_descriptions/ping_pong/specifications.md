### General

- Matches will be played on one of the tables across the campus (detailed info at the locations tab) - make sure to familiarize yourself with the location of your matches, and plan for some time to get there!
- Each player forms their own subteam and will play two matches, one against a different main team's player.
- Each match will involve two players. You may contact your opponent prior to the sports week to reschedule the match (even during a lunch break), but please write a mail to Zsofi or Fabi in this case so we can update the schedule and block the table for that slot.

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning player, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's players have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

Since table tennis matches are going to take part during the whole week, there won't be referees available at all times. We ask you to count the points fairly and report the score afterwards via sending a mail or signal message to Fabi. If there is any dispute (especially at the MPE table, it's sometimes hard to tell whether the ball went through or over the patchy net), just repeat the point - we're all here to have fun!

### What to bring

You do not need to bring any special equipment as there will be rackets and ping pong balls in each of the spots, but you may of course bring your own racket.

Get ready to showcase your agility, precision, and tactical prowess on the ping pong table. Good luck to all participating players and teams!
