### General

- Each main team can send out as many players as they want. This means that you can also easily participate even if you're scheduled as reserve.
- You do not have to take part in all of the mini events, feel free to choose the ones you enjoy.
- For the relay, each main team sends out 3 or 4 of their players to form the relay team.

### Point scheme

- For each mini-event, points will be awarded. At the end, all points your main team's players have achieved will be summed up and normalized to contribute to the main team's score.
- For the sprints and the 10-minute run, we award points based on your placement, i.e. the first player will receive $N$ points, the second $N-1$, and so on (where $N$ is the number of participants).
- For the relay, it's the same, but team-based.

At the end, all points a main team's players have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of **1** to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

ORGANIZERS will be around to structure everything.

### What to bring

Loads of motivation for giving it your all, and of course a water bottle.
