Welcome to the Spikeball event of our Sports Week!\
Spikeball, also known as Roundnet, is a dynamic and exciting sport played with a small ball and a circular net placed at ankle level. Teams of two players compete to spike the ball off the net in such a way that the opposing team cannot return it. It's a game of agility, quick reflexes, and strategic positioning.\
Get ready to spike your way to victory on the green grass of the IPP field.
