1. Each match will consist of best-of-three sets.
2. A set is won by the team first achieving 15 points, unless there is a tie at 14 points, in which case the team first having a 2-point-lead or achieving a score of 20 will win.
3. A maximum of three touches is allowed per team before the ball must hit the net again (just one or two touches are allowed as well!).
4. Players must alternate hits between teammates (exception: blocking, see advanced rules).
5. A point is awarded when the opposing team commits a fault, i.e. fails to return the ball onto the net (the ball hits the ground or the rim of the net) within their three touches, or have a double touch of one player.
6. A serve (i.e. throwing the ball up and pushing it onto the net) has to be performed outside of a two-meter-radius circle around the center of the net, and is considered faulty if the ball changes direction due to a pocket bounce, or if it touches the rim, or if it reaches a height higher than shoulder height of the receiving player. Even for a faulty serve, the receiving team may decide to play on (see advanced rules).
7. The serve is given to the team that scored the previous point, and the initial serve is awarded via a *Sprungdie* or any other *Umdie* variant (see advanced rules at the bottom).
8. The serve has to be performed by the right player if their team has an even amount of points, and by the left player if their team has an odd number of points.
9. Players must switch positions after their team wins a rally where they had the serve (so the serve stays with the same player after winning consecutive points, but faces a different opponent each time).
10. All players must rotate their starting positions by 90 degrees after each 5 points played.

See below for some advanced rules.

### Advanced rules

The following should clarify most edge cases. Note that we do not strictly follow the official rules, so please read carefully.

1. **Initial Serve**: The first serve of a game is determined via a so-called *Sprungdie*, which means that the ball is initially thrown in, starting a rally where each player putting the ball onto the net has to have their feet in the air. You may also agree upon a different variant to determine the first serve. The team winning the rally (after it has been returned at least once) gets to decide which team can perform the initial serve. For the sets following the first one, the starting serve is alternated.
2. During a serve, the serving player must first announce the score, then 'first serve' or 'second serve', and may then only perform a single step before throwing the ball up and spiking it onto the net. After they touch the ball, both feet need to be outside the 2-m-circle, and they have to stand steady in their position (they may not fall into the 2-m-circle).
3. A serve may only be received by the player across the serving player.
4. **Blocking**: If you receive the ball after it has touched the net while it is still moving upward, and propel it upward even further, this is considered a *block*. After blocking, you may touch the ball a second time yourself, and your partner will have to put it onto the net afterwards (i.e. you may not put it onto the net yourself with the second touch, and you are still limited by the three total touches). An exception is right after receiving a serve; here, you may only touch the ball once.
5. **Hinder**: If a player is blocked from reaching the ball due to a player of the opposing team being in the way, the point is repeated.
6. **Pocket**: If the ball is spiked into a pocket of the net and bounces off very unnaturally, causing the team at play to miss it, it is still a valid point. You may agree on repeating that point if all four players are fine with it.
7. "Guiding" the ball (i.e. any touch longer than a brief bounce) is considered to be a fault.
8. The ball may be touched with any part of the body, although we recommend using the front part of your flat hand.
9. Touching the net at any point during a rally is considered to be a fault.
