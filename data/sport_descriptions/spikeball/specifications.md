### General

- Matches will be played on one of the four nets we provide at LOCATION. If you own a net yourself, feel free to bring it in order to pass the spare time :)
- Each main team will send out a NUM_SUBTEAMS, with NUM_PLAYERS_SUBTEAM players on each subteam. The reserve players might be called in if a player becomes unavailable.
- Each subteam will play two matches, one against a different main team's subteam.

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning subteam, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

### What to bring

You do not need to bring any special equipment, but make sure to not forget your water bottle!

Get ready to dive, spike, and rally your way to victory in Spikeball. Good luck to all participating teams!
