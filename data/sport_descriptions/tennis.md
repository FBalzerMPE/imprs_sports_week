Welcome to the Tennis event of our Sports Week!\
Tennis is an exhilarating sport where two or four players strike a ball with rackets over a net stretched across a court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.
Get ready to serve, volley, and smash your way to victory on the IPP's tennis courts.\
Here's everything you need to know:

## Rules

1. Each match will be a single (only two players competing against each other) and it will consist of a single set.
2. A set is won by the player first achieving six games, with a margin of at least two games. In case of a 6-6 tie, a tiebreaker game is played to determine the winner.
3. A game consists of a sequence of points. The scoring system for a game is as follows:
   - 0 points: Love
   - 1 point: 15
   - 2 points: 30
   - 3 points: 40
   - 4 points: Game (if the player has a lead of at least two points)
4. A point is awarded on every serve.
5. The server must stand behind the baseline and serve diagonally across the net into the service box on the opponent's side of the court.
6. A player may hit the ball only once before it must go over the net and into the opponent's court.
7. A point is awarded when the opponent fails to return the ball in bounds or commits a fault.
8. Players must alternate service games, with the server switching sides after every game.

Refer to the section below for advanced rules.

## Format and location

- Matches will take place on the IPP's tennis courts, with three courts available for simultaneous matches.
- Each match will last around 45 minutes and consist of a single set.
- Each team will send out three single players
- Each player will play two matches, one against a different main team's player.
- 3 points are awarded to each winning player. At the end, all points a main team's players have achieved are summed and normalized to determine the contribution to the main team's score.
- We trust the players to count and announce the scores by themselves, but Matteo will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

Get ready to showcase your skills and strategy on the tennis court. Good luck to all participating players and teams!

### Advanced rules

The following advanced rules provide clarity on specific scenarios:

1. Service Faults: The server must ensure that the ball is served into the correct service box without touching the net. If the server commits a fault, they are allowed a second serve. If a fault is committed on the second serve, it results in a double fault, and the opponent is awarded the point.
2. Players must respect the service order and court boundaries during service games. Failure to do so results in a fault.
3. Players are responsible for calling out balls that land outside the court boundaries. If there is uncertainty, players may request a replay of the point.
4. The net must remain untouched during play. If a player or their racket touches the net at any time during a rally, the point is awarded to the opponent.
5. If both players are unsure whether a ball was in or out, the point is typically replayed.

Feel free to ask Matteo B. if there's anything unclear.
