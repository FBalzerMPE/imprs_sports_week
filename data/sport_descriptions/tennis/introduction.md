Welcome to the Tennis event of our Sports Week!\
Tennis is an exhilarating sport where two or four players strike a ball with rackets over a net stretched across a court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.\
Get ready to serve, volley, and smash your way to victory on the IPP's tennis courts.
