1. Each match will be a single (only two players competing against each other) and it will consist of a single set.
2. A set is won by the player first achieving six games, with a margin of at least two games. In case of a 6-6 tie, a tiebreaker game is played to determine the winner.
3. A game consists of a sequence of points. The scoring system for a game is as follows:
   - 0 points: Love
   - 1 point: 15
   - 2 points: 30
   - 3 points: 40
   - 4 points: Game (if the player has a lead of at least two points)
4. A point is awarded on every serve.
5. The server must stand behind the baseline and serve diagonally across the net into the service box on the opponent's side of the court.
6. A player may hit the ball only once before it must go over the net and into the opponent's court.
7. A point is awarded when the opponent fails to return the ball in bounds or commits a fault.
8. Players must alternate service games, with the server switching sides after every game.

Refer to the section below for advanced rules.

### Advanced rules

The following advanced rules provide clarity on specific scenarios:

1. **Service Faults**: The server must ensure that the ball is served into the correct service box without touching the net. If the server commits a fault, they are allowed a second serve. If a fault is committed on the second serve, it results in a double fault, and the opponent is awarded the point.
2. Players must respect the service order and court boundaries during service games. Failure to do so results in a fault.
3. Players are responsible for calling out balls that land outside the court boundaries. If there is uncertainty, players may request a replay of the point.
4. The net must remain untouched during play. If a player or their racket touches the net at any time during a rally, the point is awarded to the opponent.
5. If both players are unsure whether a ball was in or out, the point is typically replayed.
