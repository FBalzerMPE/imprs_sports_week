### General

- Matches will take place on the IPP's tennis courts, with three courts available for simultaneous matches.
- Each match will last around 45 minutes and consist of a single set.
- Each team will send out three single players.
- Each player will play two matches, one against a different main team's player.

### What to bring

- ⚠️Please make sure you come wearing tennis shoes! If you don't have any, contact us and we'll try to find a solution.
- If you have your own racket, please bring it, and let us know if you don't have a racket so we know how many we need to provide.
- Bring some water, the matches are going to be long!

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning player, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's players have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of **1** to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the players to count and announce the scores by themselves, but Matteo will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

Get ready to showcase your skills and strategy on the tennis court. Good luck to all participating players and teams!
