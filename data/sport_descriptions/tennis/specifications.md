### General

- Matches will take place on the IPP's tennis courts, with three courts available for simultaneous matches.
- Each match will last around 45 minutes and consist of a single set.
- Each team will send out NUM_SUBTEAMS single players.
- Each player will play two matches, one against a different main team's player.

### What to bring

- ⚠️You **ARE REQUIRED TO BRING TENNIS SHOES**.
- If you have them, please bring your tennis rackets; we'll also have a few to borrow otherwise.
- Also make sure to not forget your water bottle!

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning player, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's players have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

We trust the players to count and announce the scores by themselves, but ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

Get ready to showcase your skills and strategy on the tennis court. Good luck to all participating players and teams!
