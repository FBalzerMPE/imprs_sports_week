Welcome to the Volleyball event of our Sports Week!\
Volleyball is a fast-paced team sport where two teams compete to score points by grounding the ball on the opposing team's side of the court.
Get ready to bump, set, and spike your way to victory on the TUM sand courts.\
Here's everything you need to know:

## Rules

1. Each match will consist of best-of-three sets.
2. A set is won by the team first achieving 15 points, unless there is a tie at 14 points, in which case the team first having a 2-point-lead or achieving a score of 20 will win.
3. The rally scoring system will be used, meaning a point is awarded on every serve.
4. The serve is given to the team that scored the last point.
5. A team can hit the ball a maximum of three times before it must go over the net.
6. A point is awarded when the ball hits the ground within the opponent's court boundaries, or when the opposing team commits a fault.
7. Players must rotate positions on the court after their team wins a rally and gains the serve.
