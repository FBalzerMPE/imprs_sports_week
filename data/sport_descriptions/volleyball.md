Welcome to the Volleyball event of our Sports Week!\
Volleyball is a fast-paced team sport where two teams compete to score points by grounding the ball on the opposing team's side of the court.
Get ready to bump, set, and spike your way to victory on the TUM sand courts.\
Here's everything you need to know:

## Rules

1. Each match will consist of best-of-three sets.
2. A set is won by the team first achieving 15 points, unless there is a tie at 14 points, in which case the team first having a 2-point-lead or achieving a score of 20 will win.
3. The rally scoring system will be used, meaning a point is awarded on every serve.
4. The serve is given to the team that scored the previous point, and the initial serve is awarded via a *Sprungdie* (see advanced rules at the bottom).
5. A team can hit the ball a maximum of three times before it must go over the net, and a single player may not touch the ball twice in a row (exception: blocking, see also advanced rules).
6. A point is awarded when the ball hits the ground within the opponent's court boundaries, or when the opposing team commits a fault.
7. Players must rotate positions on the court after their team wins a rally and gains the serve.
8. **Substitutions**: A team can substitute one player every time they are rotating.

See below for some advanced rules.

## Format and location

- We'll use the two TUM beach courts for simultaneous matches. If the TUM courts are not available, we'll set up our own courts on the grass close by, and may vary the match length.
- Each main team will send out **two** subteams, with **four** players on each subteam. The reserve players may support any of the subteams, and can be switched in at the rotations.
- Each subteam will play two matches, one against a different main team's subteam.
- 3 points are awarded to each winning team, and 0 for a loss. At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed and normalized to determine the contribution to the main team's score.
- We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but Benny and Fabi will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.
- You do not need to bring any special equipment, but make sure to not forget your water bottle!

Get ready to showcase your skills and teamwork on the volleyball court. Good luck to all participating teams!

### Advanced rules

The following should clarify most edge cases. Note that we neither strictly follow indoor- nor beach rules, so please read carefully.

1. **Initial Serve**: The first serve of a game is determined via a so-called *Sprungdie*, which means that the ball is initially thrown in, starting a rally where every touch of the ball has to be done with a player's feet in the air. The team winning the rally (after it has been returned at least once) gets to decide which team can perform the initial serve. For the sets following the first one, the starting serve is alternated.
2. A serve must be performed behind the serving team's boundary line, which also may not be overstepped (or touched) at the moment the ball is touched.
3. You may touch the ball with any parts of your body, although we recommend trying to use the conventional volleyball ways.
4. "Guiding" the ball (i.e. any touch longer than a brief bounce) is considered to be a fault.
5. You may not receive a serve above the height of the upper height of the net, especially not block it directly.
6. After blocking above net's height, you may touch the ball a second time. This would then count as two distinct touches, so the next touch of your team would have to bring the ball over to the other team's side.
7. We are playing with lenient rules concerning how the ball has to be touched after receiving it from the other team, it may be touched any way (as opposed to Beach rules, where overhand passing touches are not allowed during the receive).
8. The net may not be touched at any time during a rally. Doing so is considered a fault. If two opposing players touch the net at the same time, the point is repeated.
9. If both teams are unsure whether a ball was in or out, the point is repeated.

Feel free to ask Benny or Fabi if there's anything unclear.
