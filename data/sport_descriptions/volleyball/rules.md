1. Each match will consist of best-of-three sets.
2. A set is won by the team first achieving 15 points, unless there is a tie at 14 points, in which case the team first having a 2-point-lead or achieving a score of 20 will win.
3. The rally scoring system will be used, meaning a point is awarded on every serve.
4. The serve is given to the team that scored the previous point, and the initial serve is awarded via a *Sprungdie* (see advanced rules at the bottom).
5. A team can hit the ball a maximum of three times before it must go over the net, and a single player may not touch the ball twice in a row (exception: blocking, see also advanced rules).
6. A point is awarded when the ball hits the ground within the opponent's court boundaries, or when the opposing team commits a fault.
7. Players must rotate positions on the court after their team wins a rally and gains the serve.
8. **Substitutions**: A team can substitute one player every time they are rotating.

See below for some advanced rules.

### Advanced rules

The following should clarify most edge cases. Note that we neither strictly follow indoor- nor beach rules, so please read carefully.

1. **Initial Serve**: The first serve of a game is determined via a so-called *Sprungdie*, which means that the ball is initially thrown in, starting a rally where every touch of the ball has to be done with a player's feet in the air. The team winning the rally (after it has been returned at least once) gets to decide which team can perform the initial serve. For the sets following the first one, the starting serve is alternated.
2. A serve must be performed behind the serving team's boundary line, which also may not be overstepped (or touched) at the moment the ball is touched.
3. You may touch the ball with any parts of your body, although we recommend trying to use the conventional volleyball ways.
4. "Guiding" the ball (i.e. any touch longer than a brief bounce) is considered to be a fault.
5. You may not receive a serve above the height of the upper height of the net, especially not block it directly.
6. After blocking above net's height, you may touch the ball a second time. This would then count as two distinct touches, so the next touch of your team would have to bring the ball over to the other team's side.
7. We are playing with lenient rules concerning how the ball has to be touched after receiving it from the other team, it may be touched any way (as opposed to Beach rules, where overhand passing touches are not allowed during the receive).
8. The net may not be touched at any time during a rally. Doing so is considered a fault. If two opposing players touch the net at the same time, the point is repeated.
9. If both teams are unsure whether a ball was in or out, the point is repeated.
