### General

- We'll try to use the two TUM beachvolleyball courts (courts 1 and 2) for simultaneous matches, plus two extra courts set up at the TUM football and running field (courts 3 and 4).
- This means that you might play Volleyball on the grass, so please bring shoes that are suitable.
- Each main team will send out NUM_SUBTEAMS subteams, with NUM_PLAYERS_SUBTEAM players on each subteam.
- The reserve players may support any of the subteams, and can be switched in at the rotations.
- Each subteam will play two matches, one against a different main team's subteam.

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning subteam, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

- We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

### What to bring

- You do not need to bring any special equipment (apart from shoes to play on the grass), but make sure to not forget your water bottle!

Get ready to showcase your skills and teamwork on the volleyball court. Good luck to all participating teams!
