### General

- We'll try to use the three courts set up at the TUM football and running field, so we will NOT play at the Beachvolleyball fields as we don't want to rely on them.
- This means that you will play Volleyball on the grass, so please bring shoes that are suitable.
- Any player may join any of their main teams' subteams.
- The reserve players may support any of the subteams, and can be switched in at the rotations.
- Each subteam will only play one match, but feel free to join multiple subteams!

### Point scheme

1 point is awarded to each winning subteam, and 0 for a loss.\
At the end, all points a main team's subteams have achieved are summed, normalized and weighted by a factor of WEIGHT_FACTOR to determine the contribution to the main team's score.

### Refereeing

- We trust the teams to count and announce the scores by themselves, but ORGANIZERS will be around if any questions arise, and people that are taking a break may volunteer to referee games.

### What to bring

- You do not need to bring any special equipment (apart from shoes to play on the grass), but make sure to not forget your water bottle!

Get ready to showcase your skills and teamwork on the volleyball court. Good luck to all participating teams!
