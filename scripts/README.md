# Scripts directory

This directory contains a few scripts and jupyter notebooks to

- sanitize data from the polls, 
- set up the teams, 
- schedule the matches, 
- generate nicknames + pictures,
- automatically send emails to all participants,
- adjust teams/matches for late sign-ups/drop-outs, and
- enter results.
