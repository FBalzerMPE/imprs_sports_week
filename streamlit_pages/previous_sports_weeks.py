# Previous Sports Weeks

The first inter-institute sports week was held in 2024, and it was a blast! This page features a summary of the event, including the results, top scorers, and more.

All in all, an astonishing amount of {len(_data.players)} players signed up and were split into {len(_data.teams)} main teams. They competed in {len(_data.sport_events)} different sports, and in the end Team A was able to secure the victory.
